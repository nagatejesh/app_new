# Welcome to App_New

## Description


This project was just a simple CRUD SpringBoot Rest application created for educational purposes. Built with Java 17, Spring framework 6 $ SpringBoot 4.

## Getting Started

To get started, fork this repo to your git and import it to your favorite IDE. I've used IntelliJ IDEA for my application developments. Feel free to use whatever you are comfortable with. 

### Setup

After importing, let it download all the dependencies (which may take some time).
The application will run on port **9080**. 
Change the port in the _application.properties_ by updating the property _server.port_, if 9080 port is being used by some other process. Now start by running 'AppApplication'.
